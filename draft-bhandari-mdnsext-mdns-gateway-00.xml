    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Service discovery using multicast DNS (mDNS) as defined in <xref
      target="RFC6762"></xref> is limited in scope to layer 3 boundaries due
      to the use of link-local scoped multicast addresses. &lt;Due to
      partitioning of network into multiple virtual local area networks and
      subnets for various reasons there is a need to extend services using
      mDNS beyond L3 boundaries... TBD elaborate&gt;</t>

      <t>Enabling Service Discovery across L3 boundaries can be accomplished
      in two ways:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Defining mDNS gateway entity at the L3 boundary that will extend
          services</t>

          <t>Modifying mDNS to use a wider scope multicast address</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This draft lists out the approach to use mDNS gateway to extend the
      services. The mDNS gateway approach has following advantages:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Optimizes service discovery traffic across the network as against
          relying on site scope multicast. Using a wider scope multicast could
          lead to services being advertised and queried creating a deluge of
          service discovery traffic depending on number of hosts, services in
          the scope.</t>

          <t>Yields to configuring and selectively extending specific/relevant
          services across the network</t>

    <section title=" Conventions and Terminology Used in this Document   ">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
      RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].</t>

      <t>This document uses the multicast DNS and DNS terminology and
      conventions from <xref target="RFC6762"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC6763"></xref>. It uses the same convention for services on
      the same link as defined in [ID-cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid], repeated here
      for quick reference:</t>

      <t>Multicast Multicast DNS works between a hosts on the same link. A set
      of hosts is considered to be "on the same link", if:</t>

      <t>when any host A from that set sends a packet to any other host B in
      that set, using unicast, multicast, or broadcast, the entire link-layer
      packet payload arrives unmodified, and</t>

      <t>a broadcast sent over that link by any host from that set of hosts
      can be received by every other host in that set</t>

      <t>The link-layer *header* may be modified, such as in Token Ring Source
      Routing [802.5], but not the link-layer *payload*. In particular, if any
      device forwarding a packet modifies any part of the IP header or IP
      payload then the packet is no longer considered to be on the same link.
      This means that the packet may pass through devices such as repeaters,
      bridges, hubs or switches and still be considered to be on the same link
      for the purpose of this document, but not through a device such as an IP
      router that decrements the TTL or otherwise modifies the IP header.

      <section title="mDNS Gateway for Wireless Netowrk">
      	<t> Deployment of wireless netowrk is very different from that of wired network. One needs to conssider security, mobility and bandwidth aspects 
      	while implementing mDNS gateway solution for wireless netowrk. 
      	</t> 	 
      	<section title="Advertisng service on wireless network">
      	<t> Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is changing the network architecture in almost every enterprise across verticals. In typical BYOD enabled Enterprice Network, different devices from the same
      	user needs to be treated differently. In Service Provider WiFi (SP WiFi) deployemnts, multiple service providers would provide their service on the same SSID. 
      	Network need to become intelligent enough to provide services to the devices in a simplistic manner without compromising security. User based and device based service advertisements
      	are primary requirements of BYOD and SP WiFi deployments.
 	</t>
 	<t>     	
      	If mDNS advertisements from distribution system (DS) are broadcasted on the SSID, then all the wireless clients would receive it and the service filters mention in [section: "Service Filters"] will not work. 
      	When wireless client sends a multicast mDNS query or report this will be unicated to Access Point (AP) so it does not need any change. 
      	Any mDNS multicast packet from DS to wireless devices should be converted to Layer2 Unicast  (Layer 3 will still be multicat) and send to the eligible clients based on the service filters.
 	</t>
 	<t>
 	When a new service instance is learned by mDNS gateway, it sends the mDNS advertisement to the network so that all the network nodes gets updated. For wireless netowrk, mDNS
 	gateway can act as passive device and respond only if wireless clients sends a mDNS query. This is very much necessory mainly for two reasons: 
 	</t>
 	<t><list style="numbers">
 		<t>This will save computation resources on the device which are used to replicate the multicast packet as layer 2 unicast for all wireless clients.</t>
 		<t>If the wireless client is in power saving mode, sending mDNS advertisement as layer 2 unicast would forcefully awake the client and it would 
 		result in to more power consumtion by wireless clients.</t>
	</list></t>
 	<t>
 	mDNS functionality is not impacted by acting as passive gateway because client would always send mDNS query when it wants to avail any service.
      	</t>	
      	</section> 	

	<section title="Device Tracking">
	<t>
	Wireless clients are very mobile in nature they can join and leave the netowrk any time. mDNS gateway should learn the service instance only from the authenticaed wireless 
	client. mDNS gateway should tag each service instance from wireless client with the client's mac address. This mac address should be used for device tracking.
	If the wireless client leave the netowrk, gateway should not wait till TTL expiry but it should actively clean up the service instance provided by that wireless client. 
	</t>
	<t>
	If the device tarcking is not enabled, then any attacker can join the network and starts advertising with large TTL value and leave the network. By changing the mac address
	attacker can join the network again to polulate the service instances with large TTL value. This would fillup up the mDNS gateway cache with huge entries and it may lead to 
	not learning to genuine services.  
	</t>   
	</section>

      	<section title="Mobility Considerations">
	<t>	
      	Wireless deployments supports seemless mobility from one location to other location. In such scenario, mDNS gateway needs to be well aware of the client location and if the location 
      	changes, mDNS gateway needs to update its mDNS cache. mDNS gateway shuold tag each service instance with the device location. Device location can be derived based on the AP
      	to which wireless client is attached. If the client who is providing any service changes its location, same needs to be reflected to mDNS gateway. If the client roams from one mDNS gateway
      	to other mDNS gateway, then the old gateway should provide the service instance information pertaining to the roamed client to the new gateway and then it must clear the mDNS 
      	cache for the client. If the mDNS gateway is not acting as passive gateway, it may choose to update the network about the new service instance it has learned.  
      	</t>
      	</section>
      	
      	<section title="mDNS traffic optimization">
        	<t>All mDNS packets are sent to multicast link local ip address. When mDNS gateway starts forwarding the mDNS advertisements across VLAN then 
        	the number of such advertisement on any network would increase. 802.11 wireless netowrk is half duplex so any packet on air would need to contend for the wireless medium 
        	to transmit the packet. If there are many mDNS packets going on air then it would impact other data traffic. mDNS traffic optimization is very much need, when 
        	mDNS gateway solution is implemented for wireless network.          
        	</t>
        	<t>
        	When services are advertised, different records comes with their owen TTL value. When TTL expires, gateway needs to send query (85%, 90% and 95% of TTL) for that record to confirm expiry of the record. 
        	If the TTL value of each record is different, then mDNS gateway needs to send query for individual record. If mDNS gateway update all the records with the same TTL,
        	it cane send a single qury (layer 3 unicast) for the service instance for all the record during expiry. Client will also respond to the query with all the records in a singal response. This would minimize
        	the mDNS traffic on air. Here the should be sent with QU bit set.
        	</t>
        	<t>
        	mDNS gateway can also send periodic mDNS generic query as layer 3 multicast (QU bit set) on air so that all the clients would respond to the query. This way mDNS gateway does not 
        	need to send unicast query to each client separately, as the cache would get updated provided query interval is less than TTL.
        	</t>
        	<t>
        	mDNS gateway for wireless network should act as passive gateway as explained in [section:Advertisng service on wireless network]. This would save some of the wireless bandwidth,
        	as without passive gateway, it needs to unicast the mDNS advertisements to all the clients weather they are interested or not.  
        	</t>
      	</section>  
      </section>
      
      <section title="Feedback to inform client about Service Denial">
        <t>Bonjour gateway applies filters to the services based on a user's context - identity, location, application and device in use. [Section "Service Filters"].
        In certain situation, user would like to know the reason of denial. Like a guest user want to access a printer service which is denied for guest profile. In such cases, 
        Bonjour gateway should be able to inform the denial message to client when the access is denied.</t>
        
        <t>Since mDNS protocol does not support to send Denial message, Gateway can formulate the deny message as if it is a service instance. For example, if the service requested is 
        "_ipp._tcp.local" then the deny message is formulated with the service instance string "Service Denied:[service name]._ipp._tcp.local". Here, [service name] would be user defined service name as configured on gateway or 
        exact service string as appear in the query. mDNS gateway would send this service instance as mDNS query response with Layer2 destination of the querrier. 
        The client who sent the mDNS query would receive this message as if it is a service advertisement. Client's mDNS software would then notify to the application about the service instance which is formulated by gateway to convey the service denial.. 
        The additional information about the service denial should be carried by TXT record. The service name, a reason code, and a text string can be printed 
        to the client service-listing screen for the user to see. In addition, contact information like Email, Phone number and URL pointing to certain web page can be included in 
        the mDNS txt record for the user to obtain addition information for the denial. The user will be able to figure out the denial reason for his service request and 
        recommended action.
