Authors' workflow, once you have setup git locally and pulled the mdns-gateway project:
1. checkout the draft-*.xml - git checkout draft-*.xml
2. Edit using XMLEditor app
3. execute "make" (setup path to include current dir)
4. Check generated draft-*.txt to check if it is built
5. make clean to delete .txt
6. Diffs can be viewed using : git diff <filename>
7. checkin draft-*.xml
    git add draft-*.xml
